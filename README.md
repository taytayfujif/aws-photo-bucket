[Advanced] AWS-sdk, s3, API Gateway, Lambda, Serverless, and ES6 Methods

Prerequisites
Basic understanding of JSON data.
Basic understanding of AWS Lambda
Basic understanding of Amazon S3
Basic understanding of Amazon API Gateway
Basic understanding of Serverless
Objective

   +-- index.html
   +-- styles.css
   +-- app.js
Create Serverless boilerplate/template
Run command to create package.json file
Install aws-sdk
Instructions
Build AWS Lambda function that makes a GET request to S3 bucket treasure-chest-capstone.

Look for the correct aws-sdk s3 service in documentation method in your lambda function to list contents of public S3 bucket.

Allow CORS in your serverless.yml

Create header in your lambda function to allow CORS

You will be using the Key value from your API response to dynamically display all the images from public S3 bucket in your app.js

Use public S3 bucket image path to help you display all images https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/treasure-chest-capstone/YOUR_RENDERED_KEY_HERE.

Create a button. When user clicks the button, it should initiate an Axios GET request to your specific Lambda URL, which then triggers your specific lambda to make a request to the treasure-chest-capstone S3 bucket, then will dynamically display all the images from the public S3 bucket on to the client-side.

Use the aws-cli commands referenced below to enable static website hosting on YOUR S3 bucket. Then run appropriate command to sync your client-side files to your bucket(ie. html, css, js files). Your public url will be in the format of http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com/. Test url in browser

Make Bucket A Static Website

aws s3 website s3://website-bucket-name/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html
Sync client-side files to Static Website Bucket

aws s3 sync projectfolder s3://website-bucket-name --acl public-read
